1. Plan and Set Up the Project
    Define Requirements: Clearly outline the functionalities your API will have, such as:
    Adding a product
    Deleting a product
   Updating a product
Fetching a list of all products
Fetching details of a single product
Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
Database: MySQL.
2. Set Up Development Environment
Install Required Tools:
Set up your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ for Java).
Install necessary frameworks (e.g., Spring Boot for Java).
Set up your database.
Create Project Structure:
Set up a basic project structure (e.g., controllers, services, models in Java or routes).
3. Design the API Endpoints
Define the necessary RESTful endpoints with the corresponding HTTP methods:
POST /products: Add a new product.
GET /products: Get a list of all products.
GET /products/{id}: Get details of a single product by ID.
PUT /products/{id}: Update an existing product by ID.
DELETE /products/{id}: Delete a product by ID.
4. Set Up Models and Database
Create Product Model: Design a product model or schema with attributes like:
id: Product ID
name: Product name
description: Product description
price: Product price
category: Product category
Set Up the Database:
Connect your project to the database (via JDBC for Java, ORM for Python or Node.js).
Create a products table or collection in the database.
5. Develop API Endpoints
Controllers or Routes: Implement the controller (Java) or route handlers (Node.js, Python) to handle HTTP requests for each API endpoint.
Services or Business Logic: Implement the service layer (for Java or Node.js) to handle business logic, such as adding, deleting, or updating products.
Repository Layer: Implement database interactions for performing CRUD operations on products.
6. Testing
Manual Testing: Use tools like Postman or cURL to test each endpoint individually (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).
Automated Testing: Optionally, write unit or integration tests to ensure that your API behaves as expected.
7. Run the API
Start the application, ensure itâ€™s connected to the database, and run it locally.
Verify the API by testing each endpoint to ensure the correct response is returned for each request.
8. Handle Error Responses and Validation
Implement error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for product not found, 400 for bad input, etc.).
Add validation for product data before adding or updating.
